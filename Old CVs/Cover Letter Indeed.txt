Hello!
I believe I would be a good addition to your team as I have advanced communication skills, proven through my high level qualifications in Speech and Drama.  I will be able to effectively work as part of a communicating team to accomplish all tasks.  

I have no problem meeting new people and speaking with strangers, so I can easily advise customers without confusion. 

I have advanced IT skills, and can help with computer systems if needed. I am a confident, quick learner and would love to be a part of your team!

Thank you for your attention!
Daniel Mackle,
